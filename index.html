            <p>The Copa América is the oldest football competition of national teams in the world. It was disputed
                for the first time in a trial edition in 1910, but it had its first official edition between July 2
                and 17, 1916, as part of the commemorations of the centennial of Argentina's independence. In
                addition to the host country, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil also.<br>

                From its first edition until 1967 the tournament was called the Campeonato Sudamericano de
                Selecciones.. In the first edition, Uruguay won the championship, after a 0-0 match against
                Argentina in the final played at the Racing Club of Avellaneda stadium.<br>

                Since 1975, in its 30th edition, the tournament was officially called Copa América. With the change
                of name there were also changes in the dispute system. The point-by-point system was replaced by a
                format similar to that of the FIFA World Cup: qualifying phase, with the selections distributed in
                groups, followed by qualifying rounds</p>
